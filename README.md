# Sentiment-Analysis-using-CNN

This project is a guided one.

The functionalities of most of the cells present in the programs have been thoroughly explained using docstrings and 
comments.

The data set used for this project is licensed under Stanford Learning and a link has been provided for the same.
If you create a folder in your personal Google Drive which matches the same names as that of the ones mentioned in the 
program, then your code will run just fine.

The train dataset couldn't be loaded as it exceeded the 25MB limit of GitHub, but the data set is easily available without bounds on the website:

Thank you.
